# Predicting Microinsurance Dropout Risk in Sub-Saharan Africa
## Problem
Despite the growth in microinsurance across Africa, dropout rates are alarmingly high, especially within the first year of enrollment. This leads to:

• Poor risk pooling for insurers

• Disruption in health coverage for vulnerable populations

• Inefficient use of subsidy and donor funds

## Solution
Build a predictive model that can identify beneficiaries at high risk of dropping out of a microinsurance plan within 6–12 months of enrollment.
